When I see people in India screaming and shouting to support their religion I feel that they are missing the point. In India we are too concerned with what is happening with other people and we take the freedom we have for granted. That is especially the case when it comes to Religion. Religious co-existence has been a topic high on everyones discussion list. Especially every time a terrorist attack takes place.I have seen a very different kind of religious tolerance and co-existence here in UK. Few examples I shall present through photographs taken in and around Southall, an area known for its 'Indian' feel. There are lot of Sikhs living in and around Southall. It is home to one of the largest gurudwaras outside India (photographs can be seen on my website).Above: Church advertising in Punjabi.Above: The gurudwara (Shri Guru Singh Sabha) faces a Christian cemetary. This picture was taken from the Gurudwara entrance.Above: Shree Ram Mandir next to a Christian cemetary in Southall.Above: A march for religious unity on the occassion of Christmas.I think my friend put it really nicely that day... that when you are in your own country you can scream and shout about religion all you want but when you are outside your brain works in a straight line because you don't have any options. Could we have a Ram Temple next to a Christian cemetary in India? Would we think of making one? Maybe religious tolerance is just a question having no options or having too many options?
