First part of this post can be found here.Journey to the West is a Chinese classic. It is an epic (fictional) story about how Buddhist teachings were brought to China.The English Language version (Chinese Foreign Languages Press edition translated by W.J. F. Jenner) is full of amazing quotes. I will be posting my favourite ones here.Quote 5: Chapter 59"The traveller feels lonely on the road;Monastic robes do not keep out the cold" Quote 6: Chapter 60"Don't push around your best friend's wife;Don't try to destroy the joy of his life"Quote 7: Chapter 67"There is an old saying that persimmon trees have seven perfections:1. They prolong life.2. They are very shady.3. No birds nest in them.4. They are free of insects.5. Their leaves are beautiful after frost.6. The fruit is excellent.7. The branches and leaves are big and fat."Quote 8: Chapter 70"By being too clever one becomes a fool;What was once a joke can turn out to be real"Quote 9: Chapter 73"You are never poor if you are at home;but poverty on a journey is killing"Quote 10: Chapter 73"Weeping eyes meeting weeping eyes;One broken heart coming across another"Quote 11: Chapter 73"While good deeds stay at home;Bad deeds are known far and wide"Quote 12: Chapter 77"No thread can be spun from a single strand;Nobody can clap with a single hand"Quote 13: Chapter 80"A mountain can't stop the road; it can find its own way across"Quote 14: Chapter 80"Do not fail to do a good deed because it is small;do not commit a bad deed because it is small"
