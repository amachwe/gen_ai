The second season of Swayamvar starring Rahul Mahajan is currently the number one TV show of  India. The show is supposed to end on the 6th of March and this time they have promised us a marriage!I like this program because it blows away some serious concepts in marriages. At the same time it exposes the dark side of human nature.In last nights episode he travelled to meet the family of the first girl (Harpreet Chhabra). Harpreet's family members were obviously treating it is if a boy had come to meet the family for her marriage. They asked him whether he has any 'demands' [for dowry]. Did they realise he was on camera being view by half of India? Even if he wanted something would he have said so on air? Women activists would be buring his effigy all across India if he had. But this shows that dowry is still a big issue.Now the second point: usually when marriage is being discussed between two families it is usually between TWO families! The process is quite sequential. In this case he has to visit three other families who are expected to discuss marriage equally seriously! He has to interact with girls at individual level as if SHE is the one, which is impossible at the deepest level. The problem is that this can be taken in two ways:1) Either he is really good at compartmentalising emotions and such deep interactions... which means there is full scope for other women in his life, perhaps even after marriage.2) He has already made up his mind and all this is acting.But this show has made bride hunting similar to buying a house where you have multiple deals going on at once. A new concept indeed in marriages. Will this be used by families to parallelise bride hunting? Make it more efficient? Especially keeping in mind, like good houses, brides are in short supply?
