If you are getting Timeout or Pre-login Errors when trying to access MS SQL Server Express 2008 from a Windows Vista based client then read on!Some of the reasons behind these errors (and the solutions) are given here:http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190181.aspxIf the above does NOT resolve the error (as in my case) then before you start cursing Microsoft try this:Go to the Network and Internet –> Network ConnectionsRight click on the connection being used (WiFi or LAN or any other).I found IPv6 and and Link-Layer Topology protocols enabled which I disabled.This partially resolved the issues. Database access was quite stable and I was able to do some of the work. But still things were not 100% normal. I was loosing the wireless connection and it was showing me connected to an ‘unidentified network’. Even the internet stopped working if the computer went into standby.This it seems is a very common problem and more info can be found on the Microsoft site.This problem results fromA) Issues with DHCP implementation difference between Vista and XP.Read for solution: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928233B) Issues with power management profiles and WiFi networksRead for solution: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928152
