Does the world exist around us or do we exist in it? I think the answer to this question reveals a lot about a persons thought process. Most people will obviously ask what is the difference between the two views. What is the choice that we are being given in the question?The fundamental difference in the choices is  the net flow of influence. Do you end up influencing the world around you or are you influenced by it? For most people there is no net flow because situations where the world dictates you are balanced by situations where you dictate the world.In fact if there is no net flow then you are doing well in life according to me.
