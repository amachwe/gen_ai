Last few weeks I had been living alone in my shared house. So when someone came to stay here for a few weeks my mind went back to the people who had stayed in this house over the last four years that I have been living here.Since I moved in here in July 2004, I have had more than 15 different housemates. Few stayed for a couple of weeks and few for a full year. This made me feel as if I am sitting on the banks of the river of life which flows through my house.Often people stop for a while and interact with me. Then they move on. All the while I remain sitting on the banks, observing events unfolding around me. I the observer, them the observed. :)But somewhere I feel that I don't have much time left. My time on the bank is drawing to a close. When I am gone, someone else shall take my place and maybe for them I will be the passerby, who stops for a bit and then moves on.Whatever happens, I know one thing. I have left my mark on the grassy banks of this broad and fast-flowing river. As the marks fade with time after I have left and the river of life changes its course erasing any trace of my presence, I shall have no regrets.I shall know that I got this chance to sit by the river of life and observe the flow. I shall know it was but my destiny to rejoin it, as it flows.
