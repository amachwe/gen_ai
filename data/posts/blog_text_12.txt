The Tao-te ChingÂ is fundamental to the Taoist school of philosophy. It is a gift to the world from ancient China.About achieving greatness it says the following:Plan for what is difficult while it is easy, do what is great while it is small.The most difficult things in the world must be done while they are still easy, the greatest things in the world must be done while they are still small.For this reason sages never do what is great, and this is why they can achieve that greatness.The above words written thousands of years ago still hold true. Keeping in shape is easier than loosing loads of weight. Saving early and regularly is easier than waiting for that one big injection of money!
