Life has taught me many important things.  The main difference between being alone and feeling lonely is one of those things.Being alone is a feeling that there is no one person in this worlld who cares about you as an equal. In other words there is no one who loves you.Feeling lonely is about not having people around you. It may mean that one special person or even a special friend/family member. Loneliness has a cure. Being alone doesn't.One of the benchmarks of a successful relationship is whether it addresses the feeling of loneliness. Perhaps more important than that is whether it can prevent you from being alone!You may feel lonely when your love is not around. But if your relation is real, you will never feel alone. Where ever you may be. You will never feel alone!
