Journey to the WestÂ is a Chinese classic. It is an epic (fictional) story about how Buddhist teachings were brought to China.The English Language version (Chinese Foreign Languages Press edition translated by W.J. F. Jenner) is full of amazing quotes. I will be posting my favourite ones here.Quote 1: Chapter 26"If you don't fight, you can't make friends"Quote 2: Chapter 31"If a man has been your teacher for a day, you should treat him as your father for the rest of his life"Quote 3: Chapter 33"A tall tree invites the wind; The wind then shakes the tree;Whoever strives for fame; destroyed by fame is he"Quote 4: Chapter 44"In the dust under one's eyes are three thousand worlds"
