I feel respect is more important in any kind of relationship than merely liking a person.Likes and dislikes tend to change. A person you dislike today you may end up liking tomorrow.Respect is a whole different story. Respect is gained over a period of time and once lost, is hard to regain.Relationships cannot survive without mutual respect. It forms a deeper bond which can sometimes hold a relation together even when like has turned to dislike. So remember people respect should come before love!:)
