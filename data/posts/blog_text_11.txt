While I was waiting at the roadside today morning I had a very strong insight about life which I want to share with you.We all, sometimes, crib about life being tough and there being issues.I realised that life is not tough. We make it tough by resisting it.We expect life to be like a pillow. In reality we have to be like a bullet. A bullet offers minimum resistance to the air, it is hard and goes through stuff.So be a bullet. Don't resist life andÂ at the same time be tough so that you have the power to go through things that come in the way!
