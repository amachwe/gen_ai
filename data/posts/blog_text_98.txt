Everything is cyclic. Seasons, life and the whole world.Why? I wonder why!A news item yesterday proudly proclaimed: 'The market for e-learning, in India, to grow by 40%'The story was about how Indian tutors are giving tuitions to students in the US via the Internet. The popular subject being Math since 'Indians are known for their Math skills'. Online lessons cost one-sixth of the price of normal tuitions. US is known for higher education. Thousands of students from all over the world make a bee-line for US universities every year. Yet the domestic levels of Math and Science education have been falling in the US.Thus the circle is complete. We teach them at school level and they teach us at college level. The circles are also getting bigger.I guess Globalisation is another term for the completion of the circle.
