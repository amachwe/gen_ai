The Indian public is good sandwich material. At one end we have the Government machinery (politicians etc.) squeezing the public. At the other end we have various anti-social elements (some of whom go on to become politicians!).The Government machinery (elected BY the people FOR the people) squeezes the people from the top. Ensuring that people struggle through life. Infrastructure is built up slowly, at snail's pace. When something is built up the anti-social elements squeeze from the bottom by trying to disrupt the normal flow of life.So the Indian public is good sandwich material for Government and the anti-social elements!
