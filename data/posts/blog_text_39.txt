One would think a Registrar's Office where probably crores worth of property changes hands every day life is pretty dull and weighed down under thick dusty files. But no! Any place where big things happen (like people buying their first house or probably registering their last will) can be anything but dull. In fact it is full of stories!One would wonder why is the place not clean and how come people who can spend lakhs to buy a property do not have civic sense to use a dustbin. Why don't the civic authorities have common sense to put dustbins in a place visited by hundred of people a day!There was a large group of young Army jawans there to register their wills. People who don't have control over their destiny. I wonder how it must feel to write out your will knowing that it might be used soon.There were photographs I took, some sad, some funny and some fascinating.  There was life in all its glory. Intersection of different life-flows. All in all it was a very interesting day out at the crossroads of life.[caption id="attachment_58" align="aligncenter" width="150" caption="Stone slab announcing the installation of computers at the govt. office!"][/caption][caption id="attachment_59" align="aligncenter" width="150" caption="Heaps of Garbage.."][/caption] [caption id="attachment_64" align="aligncenter" width="150" caption="Patterns on water.."][/caption]:)
