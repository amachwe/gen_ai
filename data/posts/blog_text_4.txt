Multiple bombs exploded in Ahemadabad and Bangalore.People shouldn't stop living! More people have died because of the Delhi Blue-Line bus-service related accidents than all the bomb blasts put together. No one gets scared and stops using Blue-Lines. In fact the Blue-Line service has not even been scrapped!Just because some idiots go and kill innocent people we should not let their death go to waste by allowing the people behind this to win. Especially since death is around us in every form. Everything we do has a finite probability of causing death.Let us show to the world that Indian are the best at overcoming hardships. Our ancestors overcame foreign invasions and rulership to give us this land. Let us not dissappoint them by hiding in our houses.
