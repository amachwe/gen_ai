The movie Hulla (2008) talks about how noise leads to a man loosing his peace and stability.Indian politicians seem to be trying to do the same to the masses. Trying to confuse the people with noise so that they loose their capacity to think and vote. This ensures that the real issues get clouded in the noise.Which ever channel you turn to, whatever election issue may it be (from Terrorism to Economic Slowdown) the discussion starts out quite calmly with the various people from different parties (the standard on NDTV being BJP, Congress and the Left) looking all cool and calm.The anchor introduces the people and the topic.Then the anchor puts the first question to one of the representatives. That is when the whole group of 'politicians' starts shouting at one another like a couple of sulking teenagers.Usually it is the party in power vs party wanting to be in power which, sometimes, is almost the same as party in power vs party which WAS in power 5 years ago!What we see is discussions on all issues, big or small, reduce to a shouting match with the anchor trying to guide the discussion. The attempt to guide is as affective trying to divert a flood with a straw!All the noise, all the fighting, all the personal and political battles being fought on air while the real issues are being ignored. No one is going to admit failing and no one is going to give an inch.What happens then? A stalemate. No discussion and no one party either gets questioned by the public or needs to defend itself.I wonder if this is something that all sides have implicitly agreed on. To create a noise screen to drown out the REAL questions.INDIA! WEAR EARPLUGS AND TRUST YOUR EYES!
